Briefly, the description of this problem is:

ReTau (targeted) = 300
\Delta_xPlus     = 50
\Delta_zPlus     = 15
\Delta_yPlus is performed using a 3-partition symmetric grid (method 1)
nu               = 1.9922e-4
Ub               = 1
\delta           = 1
channel dimensions = 9-by-2-by-4  (x, y, z)
